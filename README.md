# Quizaroth


Hello everyone and welcome to Quizaroth - a quiz game based on the Warcraft universe by Blizzard Entertainment.

This is the main back-end project:

1. To access the leaderboard microservice -> https://github.com/coldrefreader/Leaderboard-Service
2. To access the front-end server and UI  -> https://github.com/coldrefreader/Front-end

The primary functionality is a 10 rounds-based game where you are matched against an A.I. in singleplayer, or try to win against another player in multiplayer.

Questions, and the 3 attached answers, cover different topics of Warcraft's universe and range from the early strategy games to the most recent World of Warcraft expansion.


For singleplayer, simply click on 'Singleplayer', choose a difficulty which affects the allocated time per question and chance of the A.I. to choose successfully, and play.

For multiplayer:
1. Click on 'Multiplayer' and then 'Register'. This redirects you to the account creation page.
2. Once you successfully make an account, you will be redirected to the logging-in page.
3. Here simply put in the username and password from the previous step.
4. Upon logging in successfully, you will be redirected to the home page.
5. Here you can either create your own lobby, after which you will need to wait for another player, or click on Join-Lobby to find a free lobby.
6. Once you have a lobby with 2 players, the owner can click on 'Start Game' and your match will begin.

For testing multiplayer's functionality, 2 accounts are needed. I recommend either an incognito tab for the second one, or a second browser.

Apart from the lobby functionality, you have:
1. A real-time chat that anyone will see the messages in.
2. The leaderboard, shown as a ladder, which displays the top 10 players by total games and win-rate.
3. The profile page, where you can edit any of the 3 fields, or to check:
4. Your own match history page, providing you with your past 10 matches and showing your opponent's username, your score, their score and the match result.

I hope you will enjoy looking around!
