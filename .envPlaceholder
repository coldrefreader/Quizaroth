DB_URL=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=

If needed, rename the file to .env, place your Database URL, username and password like:
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:PORT/NAME?allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false&createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
DB_USERNAME=????
DB_PASSWORD=??????????

And the app should start. Of course, delete everything but the first 3 lines as well
